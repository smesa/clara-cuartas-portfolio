### Viva Taxi Mobile App
The usability exercise was particularly interesting, given the broad and diverse audience it aimed to reach, making the design challenge considerable. Extensive testing was conducted with different user groups to identify and resolve accessibility and navigation issues. The insights gained allowed for the optimization of the user interface (UI) to make it intuitive and easy to use, facilitating the adoption of the app by taxi drivers, many of whom are not familiar with advanced digital technologies.
