### Brand Identity and Responsive Design
The design of the Movi platform was a significant challenge as it required creating a unique brand identity while maintaining the integrity of Sura's overarching brand. The outcome was a platform that upheld visual coherence and Sura's values, ensuring an optimal user experience.

### Collaborative Design Process
As a UX/UI Designer, I closely collaborated with Sura employees and participated in user interviews to understand their needs and expectations. All the collected information was meticulously organized and shared with the programming team to ensure the final product was functional and aligned with user expectations. The result was a robust and user-friendly application that facilitates vehicle buying and selling with the support and trust of Sura.

The platform's user-centric design incorporates accessible design elements such as adjustable font sizes and appropriate color contrast to ensure usability for all users. The attention to detail in the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design ensures that Autos SURA Movi is not only a functional tool but also a pleasant and enriching experience for all users.

Overall, the "Autos SURA Movi" project successfully transformed the platform into a dynamic and supportive environment for vehicle buyers and sellers. The new design and development efforts have positioned the platform as a leading tool in the automotive sector, offering a compelling and accessible user experience that supports the needs of users and upholds the values of Sura.
