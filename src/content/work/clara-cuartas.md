### Brand Identity and Empathy

The new brand identity reflects the essence of its creator, Clara Cuartas, by combining empathy and human development knowledge to add significant value to each product. The brand’s visual language was carefully crafted to evoke trust, warmth, and professionalism.

An extensive image manual was developed to ensure consistency across all brand touchpoints. This manual includes guidelines for color usage, typography, and imagery to maintain a unified and professional appearance.
