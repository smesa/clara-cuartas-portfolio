### Branding
Belleza Absurda seeks to inspire everyone to love and accept themselves as they are, with their scars and differences, understanding that true beauty lies in authenticity and not in superficial standards. This is why the brand's design is marked with lines and circles symbolizing freckles, scars, and various marks.

The lines and circles in the branding represent these personal stories and symbolize the beauty in imperfection and individuality. This design approach not only visually communicates the brand's message but also creates an emotional connection with users, reminding them that each mark and scar has a unique and valuable story.

### Podcast
The design is not only aesthetic but also profoundly meaningful, as it emerged from interviews with members of the community. During these interviews, many shared how Belleza Absurda not only helps them accept their physical traits but also heal the emotional scars. These visible and invisible marks define us and show us in different ways.

One of the most significant pieces is a Self-Love Booklet, created from the experiences that helped heal Juliana and her team. I had the opportunity to support the creative process alongside Malory, a talented illustrator whose purpose is also to share her story through comics. The booklet not only visually communicates the brand's message but also creates an emotional connection with users, reminding them that each mark and scar has a unique and valuable story.

The "Belleza Absurda" project successfully transformed the platform into a dynamic and supportive environment for its community. The new design and development efforts have positioned Belleza Absurda as a leading voice in promoting self-love and acceptance, offering a compelling and accessible user experience that supports the needs of users and upholds the values of authenticity and community.
