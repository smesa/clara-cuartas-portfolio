## The challenge

The challenge of this project was to create an application to visualize the Espiga Cervecería menu, aiming to help regular and new customers get to know the food and beverage offerings, facilitating orders in different sectors of the extensive countryside environment. Additionally, the payment process was streamlined, especially for large groups visiting the location.

Although Espiga Cervecería is known for its excellent beer and is a popular spot among groups of friends, the goal was to expand the target audience and transform it into a meeting place for families and friends. The solution involved a redesign of the menu to create attractive options for everyone, including older adults, children, and pets. The goal is to leverage the countryside environment to create an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere where all family members can enjoy and have fun.

## Design and Usability

The digital menu redesign included a color palette with appropriate contrasts, ensuring that people with visual difficulties can view the content without problems. Accessibility options were implemented, allowing users to adjust the font size and choose between a dark mode and a light mode. These adjustments ensure a personalized and accessible experience for all visitors.

Usability tests conducted yielded very favorable results, demonstrating that the redesigned interface significantly improved the user experience. The interface was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing customers to explore the menu and place orders with ease. Attention to detail in both design and functionality ensures that the application is a useful and attractive tool for all users.

This project demonstrates how UI/UX design can transform a traditional space into a modern and accessible experience, ensuring all visitors feel welcome and attended to. Implementing this digital tool positions Espiga Cervecería as an ideal destination to enjoy good food, excellent beer, and a natural, welcoming environment.
